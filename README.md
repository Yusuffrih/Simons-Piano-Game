Simon's Piano is a web page that provides the user with a fun game to play. The game takes it's inspiration from the original Simon game but with it's own twist on it, the twist being that it's played through a piano keyboard. When the keys are pressed, they make a sound which represents a note on the piano.

The game is primarily about providing the user with a fun time, but it has other goals. It aims to inspire people to begin playing music, whether that is piano, guitar or any other instrument. Through playing the game, people will hopefully realise that they can easily learn to play a couple of songs which might start them on their inspired journey to learning to play an instrument. 

Simon's Piano aims to be a really simple game and web-page overall that doesn't take any time or skill to start playing. I hope you enjoy!
