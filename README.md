# Simon's Piano

![Am I responsive image to go here](assets/images/readme-imgs/am-i-responsive.png)

Simon's Piano is a web page that provides the user with a fun game to play. The game takes it's inspiration from the original Simon game but with it's own twist on it, the twist being that it's played through a piano keyboard. When the keys are pressed, they make a sound which represents a note on the piano.

The game is primarily about providing the user with a fun time, but it has other goals. It aims to inspire people to begin playing music, whether that is piano, guitar or any other instrument. Through playing the game, people will hopefully realise that they can easily learn to play a couple of songs which might start them on their inspired journey to learning to play an instrument. 

Simon's Piano aims to be a really simple game and web-page overall that doesn't take any time or skill to start playing. I hope you enjoy!

### Design Choices
To keep the game nice and simple for the user, I decided to keep the colour scheme basic. The user’s attention should be drawn to the game area as soon as possible with no confusion about what the aim of the game is. To achieve this, the game area is going to be placed in the middle of the screen with a contrasting background colour. 

#### Fonts: 
There is very little text on the landing page so as not to distract the user and not to take attention away from the game area. For the fonts, I decided to go to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?standard-styles=) which is great for getting any kind of font you want. The fonts I chose for my page are *Dancing Script* & *Lato* with *sans-serif* as a backup font in the event that Google Fonts does not work. The reason I decided to use *Dancing Script* is that it is quiet a beautiful, artistic font which would almost represent the art of a piano and music. 

#### Colours:
When deciding what colour scheme to choose for my project, I decided to keep it really simple with a black and white colour scheme to be similar to the colours of a piano. This has the effect of being simple yet sleek and visually appealing. And, of course when choosing the colours of the white piano keys, I had to choose ivory over white. 

I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to generate a colour scheme for the site. This is a really cool site that randomly generates colour schemes. You can keep generating new colour schemes until you find ones that fits your requirements. The site provides you with the [Hex value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) of the colours so you can just copy and paste it into your code. See below for my choice of colour scheme.
